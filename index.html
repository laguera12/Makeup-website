<h1> Makeup is life </h1>

<p id="sentence1"> Makeup is self-confidence applied directly to the face.</p>
<p id="sentence2"> We love makeup. </p>
<p> My intended audiance are the teenagers or womens how are intrested in makeup or love doing their makeup. We apply makeup in our faces to feel self-confidence because it's something you love to do. When we do our makeup is like doing art because we love our makeup. Its a huge passion liking makeup because you would go crazy when a new eyeshadow palette comes out. Makeup application can be a complicated business, as we all follow our own set of rules and protocol when it comes to putting our faces on.
